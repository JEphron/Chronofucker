##TimeCube

If you would acknowledge 
simple existing math proof 
that 4 harmonic corner days 
rotate simultaneously around 
squared equator and cubed 
Earth, proving 4 Days, Not 
1Day,1Self,1Earth or 1God 
that exists only as anti-side. 
This page you see - cannot 
exist without its anti-side 
existence, as +0- antipodes. 
Add +0- as One = nothing. 

Note: This project requires images2gif. There is a bug in images2gif.py which you must fix manually.

You must find

    for im in images:
        palettes.append( getheader(im)[1] )
and replace it with

    for im in images:
        palettes.append(im.palette.getdata()[1])


###TODO:
Need more speed. Considering writing an OpenCL or OpenGL compute shader kernel.
